# Simple Todo App

This is an app to create and track progress for tasks created in a simple UI by end-users.

## Functionality

This app uses popup forms to create a task name and an optional due date. There is also a checkbox to track whether a task has been completed.

## Technology

This app uses HTML and CSS to provide a clean, organized layout with dynamic functionality provided by JavaScript. Modules(classes) are used in JavaScript to keep the code organized and readable. The date input utilizes a browser's built in functionality to make date entry as easy as a couple of mouse clicks. The app also uses an external CDN to dynamically and procedurally create IDs for newly created tasks.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages:
